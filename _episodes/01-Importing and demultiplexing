## Questions to guide data analysis.

What value would you choose to pass for --p-sampling-depth? How many samples will be excluded from your analysis based on this choice? Approximately how many total sequences will you be analyzing in the core-metrics-phylogenetic command?

What sample metadata or combinations of sample metadata are most strongly associated with the differences in microbial composition of the samples? Are these associations stronger with unweighted UniFrac or with Bray-Curtis? Based on what you know about these metrics, what does that difference suggest? For exploring associations between continuous metadata and sample composition, the commands qiime metadata distance-matrix in combination with qiime diversity mantel and qiime diversity bioenv will be useful. These were not covered in the Moving Pictures tutorial, but you can learn about them by running them with the --help parameter.

What do you conclude about the associations between continuous sample metadata and the richness and evenness of these samples? For exploring associations between continuous metadata and richness or evenness, the command qiime diversity alpha-correlation will be useful. This was not covered in the Moving Pictures tutorial, but you can learn about it by running it with the --help parameter.

Which categorical sample metadata columns are most strongly associated with the differences in microbial community richness or evenness? Are these differences statistically significant?

In taxonomic composition bar plots, sort the samples by their average soil relative humidity, and visualize them at the phylum level. What are the dominant phyla in these samples? Which phyla increase and which decrease with increasing average soil relative humidity?

What phyla differ in abundance across vegetated and unvegetated sites?

How do your conclusions differ if you skip the subsampling step above, if at all?
